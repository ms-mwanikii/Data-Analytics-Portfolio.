 Hospital Data Analysis using Excel
üìò Project Overview

This project explores hospital operations and patient data using Microsoft Excel.
The goal was to transform raw hospital data into actionable insights that can help improve decision-making in areas such as billing, staffing, and patient care.

 Objectives
The analysis focused on five key questions:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Bill per Department
Which departments generate the highest average bills, and what does that reveal about hospital costs?
2Ô∏è‚É£ Number of Patients per Doctor
How evenly are patients distributed among doctors?
3Ô∏è‚É£ Number of Patients per Diagnosis
What are the most common medical conditions among patients?
4Ô∏è‚É£ Average Stay of Patients (by Department and Doctor)
How long do patients stay on average, and what might longer stays indicate?
5Ô∏è‚É£ Insured vs Non-Insured Patients
What proportion of patients are insured, and how does that impact revenue and accessibility?

üß© Data Cleaning & Preparation
Steps performed in Excel:
Removed duplicates and missing values
Standardized column names
Converted text fields to proper data types (dates, numbers, categories)
Created helper columns for analysis (e.g., Average Bill, Insurance Status)

Analysis & Insights
Theme	Key Insight
Bill per Department	Orthopedics and Pediatrics recorded the highest average bills ‚Äî major revenue drivers but also potential cost pressure points.
Patients per Doctor	Some doctors handle significantly more patients, suggesting a need for workload balancing.
Patients per Diagnosis	Heart disease and cancer were the most common diagnoses ‚Äî key areas for preventive care.
Average Stay (by Dept & Doctor)	Longer stays in Orthopedics and Neurology likely due to complex post-surgery recovery.
Insured vs Non-Insured	Majority of patients were insured, but a notable number weren‚Äôt ‚Äî room for flexible payment options or new insurance partners.

Tools & Skills Used
Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboarding)
Descriptive Statistics for insight generation
Data Visualization for presenting findings clearly

Key Takeaways
This project demonstrates how Excel can be used for real-world analytics ‚Äî from raw data cleaning to actionable insights ‚Äî without the need for advanced BI tools.
It also showcases critical thinking and storytelling with data, essential skills for a data analyst.
